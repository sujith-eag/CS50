Just the notes taken and codes tried while taking the, CS50 Course on introduction to programming with python from David Malan from Harvard.

It was a flurry of information at a very meticulously planned routine with clear examples and a bottom up incremental approach to the problem solving.
It covered the most of the variables, data types, functions, conditionals, methods, exceptions, object oriented programming, functional programming.

but the highlight of it was the teaching of malan and how he gave more importance to thinking like a programmer to approach and solve problems.
